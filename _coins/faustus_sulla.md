> He [Pompey] celebrated the triumph in honour of all his wars at once, including in it many trophies beauti­fully decked out to represent each of his achievements, even the smallest; and after them all came one huge one, decked out in costly fashion and bearing an inscription stating that it was a trophy of the inhabited world ...  These [honors] consisted in the privilege of always wearing the laurel wreath at all public games, and arraying himself in the cloak of a general at all of them, as well as in the triumphal garb at the horse-races. They had been granted him chiefly through the coöperation of Caesar, and contrary to the advice of Marcus Cato.

This coin issued by Faustus, the son of the Dictator Sulla, and highlights the achievements of his father-in-law, Cnaius Pompey, known to us as [Pompey the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompey). The obverse shows young Hercules mirroring Alexander the Great's coins and symbolizing Pompey's swift rise. The reverse displays his three triumphs across the known world in Europe, Africa, and Asia (three small wreaths), a boat stern (aplustre) for clearing the Mediterranean of pirates and securing Rome's corn supply (ear of corn), and the unprecedented honor of a golden triumphal crown (large wreath). These symbols encircle a globe, reflecting Cicero's claim that through Pompey, we "witness the whole world being under our rule."[^1]

While Pompey wasn’t born “great,” he did have a talent for being in the “right place” at the “right time.” After defeating the Marians in Spain, he intercepted the remnants of Spartacus’ army, stealing Crassus’ glory in the Third Servile War. Seizing the moment, Pompey refused to disband his legions until he and Crassus were elected Consuls. Later, after his anti-piracy campaign, he conveniently “happened” to be near Asia when the Tribunes handed him control of the Third Mithridatic War. Sulla gave the nickname Magnus in gest after Pompey requested a triumph for victories in Africa.  Sulla initially refused but relented after Pompey hinted that “more people worship the rising sun than the setting sun.”

Pompey was at the peak of his power when this coin was issued during the First Triumvirate with Caesar and Crassus. However, within a year, Crassus dies in Parthia, and in two years, Pompey’s beloved wife (and Caesar’s daughter), Julia, shattering the alliance. Then, in 49 BC, Pompey and Caesar found themselves on opposite sides of a civil war neither wanted. The obstinate Optimates refused to compromise with Caesar. They goaded Pompey, against his better judgment, into the final battle at Pharsalus and his eventual end on the banks of the Nile.
