      <p>He [Pompey] celebrated the triumph in honour of all his wars at once, including in it many trophies beauti­fully decked out to represent each of his achievements, even the smallest; and after them all came one huge one, decked out in costly fashion and bearing an inscription stating that it was a trophy of the inhabited world ...  These [honors] consisted in the privilege of always wearing the laurel wreath at all public games, and arraying himself in the cloak of a general at all of them, as well as in the triumphal garb at the horse-races. They had been granted him chiefly through the cooperation of Caesar, and contrary to the advice of Marcus Cato.</p>

This coin issued by Faustus Cornelius Sulla, son of the Dictator Sulla, and highlights the achievements of his father-in-law, Cnaius Pompey, known to us as [Pompey the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompey). The obverse shows young Hercules mirroring Alexander the Great's coinage and symbolizing Pompey's swift rise. The reverse displays his three triumphs[^5] across the known world in Europe, Africa, and Asia (three small wreaths), a boat stern (aplustre) for clearing the Mediterranean of pirates and securing Rome's corn supply (ear of corn),[^3] and the unprecedented honor of a golden triumphal crown (large wreath).[^2] These symbols encircle a globe, reflecting Cicero's claim that through Pompey and these three triumphs, we *"witness the whole world being under our rule."*[^1]

While Pompey wasn’t born “great,” he did have a talent for being in the “right place at the right time.” Pompey had served with his father during the Social War but his rise to fame began in 83 BCE when Sulla returned to Italy. Pompey raised a legion from his father's veterans and marched to join forces with Sulla. The Senate dispatched several Marian generals to prevent the two forces linking up, but Pompey defeated these challengers. Impressing Sulla, he was hailed Imperator and supported Sulla's takeover of Rome. 



After defeating the Marians in Spain, he intercepted the remnants of Spartacus’ army, stealing Crassus’ glory in the Third Servile War. 

Seizing the moment, Pompey refused to disband his legions until he and Crassus were elected Consuls. Later, after his anti-piracy campaign, he conveniently “happened” to be near Asia when the Tribunes handed him control of the Third Mithridatic War[^4]. Sulla gave the nickname Magnus in gest after Pompey requested a triumph for victories in Africa.  Sulla initially refused but relented after Pompey hinted that “more people worship the rising sun than the setting sun.”

Pompey was at the peak of his power when this coin was issued during the First Triumvirate with Caesar and Crassus. However, within a year, Crassus dies in Parthia, and in two years, Pompey’s beloved wife (and Caesar’s daughter), Julia, shattering the alliance. Then, in 49 BC, Pompey and Caesar found themselves on opposite sides of a civil war neither wanted. The obstinate Optimates refused to compromise with Caesar. They goaded Pompey, against his better judgment, into the final battle at Pharsalus and his eventual end on the banks of the Nile.

[^1]:*"For if Pompeius had lived five hundred years ago ; if this man, from whom, while yet a mere youth and a Roman knight, the senate had frequently sought aid for the common safety, whose exploits, attended always with the most glorious victory on sea and land, had extended through all nations, whose three triumphs proved that the whole world was subject to our sway, whom the Roman people had distinguished with unprecedented and singular honours.."* -  <a href="https://www.attalus.org/cicero/balbus.html" target="_blank">Cicero, Balbo 16</a> 
[^2]:*"In Pompey's absence the tribunes of the people, Titus Ampius and [Titus Labienus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Labienus), proposed a law that at the games of the circus Pompey should be permitted to wear a golden crown and the full dress of the triumphator, and at the theatre the purple-bordered toga and the golden crown."* -<a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#40.4" target="_blank">Velleius Paterculus ii, 40, 4</a>:
[^3]: *And when Cicero returned to the city⁠ by virtue of the law then passed, he immediately reconciled Pompey to the senate, and by his advocacy of the corn law he in a manner once more made Pompey master of all the land and sea in Roman possession. For under his direction were placed harbours, trading-places, distributions of crops, — in a word, navigation and agriculture.⁠ ... Having thus been set over the administration and management of the grain trade, Pompey sent out his agents and friends in various directions, while he himself sailed to Sicily, Sardinia and Africa, and collected grain.* -<a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#ref66" target="_blank">Plutarch, Pompey 49 - 50</a> 
[^4]: *"The rest of the soldiers Pompey summoned by letter, for he had already been appointed to conduct the war against Mithridates and Tigranes, because he won the favour of the people and flattered their leaders. But the Senate and the nobility considered Lucullus a wronged man. He had been superseded, they said, not in a war, but in a triumph, and had been forced to relinquish and turn over to others, not his campaign, but the prizes of victory in his campaign".* -<a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Lucullus*.html#35.7" target="_blank">Plutarch, Lucullus 35.7</a>
