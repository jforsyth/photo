The period after Caesar's invasion was a constant stream of shifting alliances. One day, friends, the next enemies, and later, convenient allies. Few things illustrate this, like the lives of Gaius Pansa and Decimus Brutus, who both served Caesar in Gaul and during the Civil Wars. Still, one would later fight for the Senatorial faction, and the other become one of Caesar's assassins.

Both moneyers contributed to this joint issue, with the obverse a pun on Pansa's name, while the reverse of Decimus shows a caduceus and clasped hands promoting the Caesarian propaganda of moderation and reconciliation towards enemies. It was this forgiveness that led to Caesar's downfall. At some point after this issue, despite being named an heir in Caesar's will, Decimus turned on him. This trust was so complete that Decimus was sent to Caesar's house on the Eids of March to retrieve their cautious victim, allay his fears, and convey him to Pompey's Theater, where the other assassins waited.

One year later, for this betrayal, Decimius would find himself under siege by Mark Antony at Mutina. The Senate sent the year's Consuls Pansa and Hirtius with Octavian in relief, but suspiciously, both Consuls died during the battle, with rumors Octavian may have assisted their passing. The Senate, feeling triumphant, attempted to recall Brutus and Cassius and strip Octavian of his command, but the situation quickly turned. Octavian marched on Rome, was elected Consul, and declared all Caesar's assassins outlaws.  Decimus, having so recently been saved, was now trapped with Antony to the north and Octavian to the south. With his troops rapidly deserting, Decimus attempted to flee to Brutus but was eventually captured and executed on Antony's orders.

As a contemporary, Velleius wrote, "He [Decimus] met his just deserts and paid the penalty of his treason to Gaius Caesar by whom he had been treated so well."
