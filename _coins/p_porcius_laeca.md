> *In the middle of the forum of Messana a Roman citizen, O judges, was beaten with rods; while in the mean time no groan was heard, no other expression was heard from that wretched man, amid all his pain, and between the sound of the blows, except these words, "Civis Romanus Sum"*

> — Cicero, *In Verrem* 162

"Civis Romanus Sum" or "I am a Roman Citizen" was a declaration of rights and protections throughout the ancient world. Traveling abroad, a Roman citizen could be certain his status afforded deference due to fear of Rome's retribution. Against his own magistrates, he was shielded from their arbitrary power of command (*imperium*) and punishment (*coercitio*) through an appeal (*provocatio*) to the People's Assembly. Any violation of these rights was considered a "wicked act" and was so egregious that Cicero focused his prosecution, and eventual conviction, of the corrupt Sicilian governor Verres for his crime of flogging a Roman citizen.

The coin's reverse shows the *provocatio* in action. In the center, a magistrate in full armor (*paludamentum*) summons a citizen, and to the right, his lictor carries the wooden rods (*fasces*) that both symbolize and implement his authority to impose physical punishment. In protest, to the left, the citizen raises his hand invoking *provocatio*. The moneyer, P. Porcius Laeca, depicted this scene to honor his ancestor's role in securing the right of appeal via the Porcian laws of the 2nd century BCE.

Over time, this right of *provocatio* evolved as the Emperors claimed the tribunician powers and consequently control of the People's Assemblies. In this way, an appeal to the people became an appeal to Caesar. An example is found in the Book of Acts, where the apostle Paul, arrested in Judea, invokes his right as a Roman citizen to appeal to Caesar, ultimately ensuring his transport to Rome for trial.
