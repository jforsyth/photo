He was appointed proconsul to deal with the Marian rebel Sertorius’ rebellion in Spain in 76 BCE. After several years the rebellion was put down, and Pompey returned to Italy just in time to intercept the remnants of Spartacus’ army, stealing Crassus’ glory in the Third Servile War.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Seizing the moment, Pompey and Crassus sought election as consuls. Neither dismissed his army: Pompey claimed he was waiting for his triumph, and Crassus insisted he would not do so until Pompey.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Both were elected consul and Pompey <strong>acquired his second triumph</strong>.</p> <h4 id="cilician-pirates-and-the-third-mithridatic-war">Cilician Pirates and the Third Mithridatic War</h4> <p>In the subsequent years, Pompey continued to be relied on by the state to solve crises, and also inserted himself into adventures for further glory. In 67 BCE Pompey was granted an extraordinary command to deal with the issue of piracy in the Mediterranean. Granted proconsular power in any province within 50 miles of the Mediterranean and the power to appoint legates in his name<sup id="fnref:10:1"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, he was Augustus in all but name forty years before his time. While he ended the threat of piracy rapidly, in under three months, he then leveraged this opportunity to undermine Lucullus and take over his command in the Third Mithridatic War<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>,<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Seizing a war nearly won, Pompey made unreasonable surrender conditions on Mithridates to force a decisive series of battles. During this time, Pompey extended the Asian province and annexed new ones including Cilicia, Bithynia and Pontus, and Syria, extending Roman control to the entire Mediterranean seaboard which was truly “Mare Nostrum” (Our Sea).</p> <h4 id="the-road-to-pharsalus">The Road to Pharsalus</h4> <p><strong>Third triumph</strong> achieved but the seeds of Pompey’s downfall, and eventually that of the Republic, were finally sown. Upon returning to Rome, the Senate, fearful of Pompey’s rising power, refused to ratify his reorganization of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompey%27s_eastern_settlement" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">eastern provinces</a> or settlements for his veterans. With no further recourse, Pompey aligned with Crassus and <a href="coins/julius_caesar">Caesar</a> to achieve his aims through the First Triumvirate.</p> <p>The Republic could not withstand the power of these three towering individuals, and in the end, neither could they withstand each other. Crassus would die in an ill-fated adventure in Parthia, and with the death of Pompey’s beloved wife Julia, the alliance with Caesar would fully collapse — as Lucan observed, Pompey could bear no equal and Caesar no rival.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> By 49 BCE, Caesar and Pompey were opposing sides of the latest Roman civil war. The constant obstinacy of the Optimates created a conflict that neither wanted, and eventually their endless pressure forced Pompey into a battle at Pharsalus that he did not want. Pompey the Great would finally lose this battl, and then eventually his life, betrayed by Ptolemy XIII (a former client) on the banks of the Nile.</p> <h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:5"> <p>“These triumphs were: (1) on his victory in Africa over a Marian refugee Cn.
